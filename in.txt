Alas! My pharyngolaryngeal search for meatballs was untameable. Batman
thought the meatballs were raisable, but the raisable was truely the
domain of Rabelais only. In truth the parables were laryngopharyngeal, if
one could say that. The only cure for laryngopharyngeal, or perhaps only
prebasal, altitudinarian and sparable meatballs was to be ambulante. Though
a bantam weight and parsable batmen were both antilabor and blastemal.
"Halt! you maltable scoundrel!" cried the baritonal watchman. It seems
Rabelais was the only one who knew.
